# Notes
The code will not work properly if you didn't follow these:
1. Edit the main code's (game_.java) run configuration's VM options to -Djava.library.path="path to libraries"
2. Add paths of the libraries and resources_ used.
# Building
You need JarSplice to compile the code (sorry i'm so lazy), so follow the instructions carefully.
1. Make sure ".idea\artifacts\CUBESHOTS__release_alpha__jar.xml" exist, or you can create your own.
2. Build > Build Artifacts > CUBESHOTS (release alpha).jar > Build
3. Open JarSplice then Add Jars > Import CUBESHOTS (release alpha).jar, all library jars
4. Leave natives blank.
5. Input main class "gamemakerstudio_.game_"
6. Create Fat Jar.
7. Copy [resources_](https://github.com/GDjkhp/CUBESHOTS_RESOURCES/) folder to the same directory of the created fat jar.
# Installation (for non-programmers)
Download the [resources_](https://github.com/GDjkhp/CUBESHOTS_RESOURCES/) folder (use the "download as zip" option) for the resources, and the latest release (the fat jar, located at [bin](https://github.com/GDjkhp/CUBESHOTS/tree/master/bin)).\

Edit: Must be in this directory structure:\
