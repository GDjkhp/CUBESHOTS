# Notes
The code will not work properly if you didn't follow these:
1. Edit the main code's (game_.java) run configuration's VM options to -Djava.library.path="path to libraries"
2. Add paths of the libraries and resources_ used.
# Building
~~You need JarSplice to compile the code (sorry i'm so lazy), so follow the instructions carefully.~~

~~1. Make sure ".idea\artifacts\CUBESHOTS__release_alpha__jar.xml" exist, or you can create your own.~~

~~2. Build > Build Artifacts > CUBESHOTS (release alpha).jar > Build~~

~~3. Open JarSplice then Add Jars > Import CUBESHOTS (release alpha).jar, all library jars~~

~~4. Leave natives blank.~~

~~5. Input main class "gamemakerstudio_.game_"~~

~~6. Create Fat Jar.~~

~~7. Copy [resources_](https://github.com/GDjkhp/CUBESHOTS_RESOURCES/) folder to the same directory of the created fat jar.~~

# Installation (for non-programmers)
Download the [resources_](https://github.com/GDjkhp/CUBESHOTS_RESOURCES/) folder (lite/full) for the resources, and the latest release (the fat jar, located at [bin](https://github.com/GDjkhp/CUBESHOTS/tree/main/bin)).
